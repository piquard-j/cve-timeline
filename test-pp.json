If, for example, OSPF was configured with a certain bandwidth value, ISIS would also be limited to this value. So inadvertently either the control plane is open for a high level of specific traffic which was supposed to be limited to a lower value, or the limit for a certain protocol is so low that chances to succeed with a volumetric DoS attack are significantly increased. \n\n\n\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS Evolved on ACX 7000 Series:\n\n\n\n  *  All versions before 21.4R3-S7-EVO,\n  *  22.1 versions before 22.1R3-S6-EVO, \n  *  22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S3-EVO,\n  *  22.3 versions before 22.3R3-S3-EVO, \n  *  22.4 versions before 22.4R3-S2-EVO,\n  *  23.2 versions before 23.2R2-EVO,\n  *  23.4 \n\nversions \n\nbefore 23.4R1-S1-EVO, 23.4R2-EVO.","score":"7.5","source":"sirt@juniper.net","vendor":"unknown","isExploited":false,"publishedDate":"2024-07-11T17:15:10.150","lastModifiedDateFull":"2024-07-11T18:09:58.777","link":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39531","redditScore":0},{"title":"CVE-2024-39540","description":"An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (pfe) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series, and MX Series with SPC3 allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).\n\nWhen an affected device receives specific valid TCP traffic, the pfe crashes and restarts leading to a momentary but complete service outage.\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS:\n\n21.2 releases from 21.2R3-S5 before 21.2R3-S6.\n\nThis issue does not affect earlier or later releases.","score":"7.5","source":"sirt@juniper.net","vendor":"unknown","isExploited":false,"publishedDate":"2024-07-11T17:15:12.883","lastModifiedDateFull":"2024-07-11T18:09:58.777","link":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39540","redditScore":0},{"title":"CVE-2024-39542","description":"An Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MPC10/11 or LC9600, MX304, and Junos OS Evolved on ACX Series and PTX Series allows an unauthenticated, network based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).\n\nThis issue can occur in two scenarios:\n\n1.

Prior to versions 2.23.6, 2.24.4, and 2.25.2, multiple OGC request parameters allow Remote Code Execution (RCE) by unauthenticated users through specially crafted input against a default GeoServer installation due to unsafely evaluating property names as XPath expressions.\n\nThe GeoTools library API that GeoServer calls evaluates property/attribute names for feature types in a way that unsafely passes them to the commons-jxpath library which can execute arbitrary code when evaluating XPath expressions. This XPath evaluation is intended to be used only by complex feature types (i.e., Application Schema data stores) but is incorrectly being applied to simple feature types as well which makes this vulnerability apply to **ALL** GeoServer instances. No public PoC is provided but this vulnerability has been confirmed to be exploitable through WFS GetFeature, WFS GetPropertyValue, WMS GetMap, WMS GetFeatureInfo, WMS GetLegendGraphic and WPS Execute requests. This vulnerability can lead to executing arbitrary code.\n\nVersions 2.23.6, 2.24.4, and 2.25.2 contain a patch for the issue. A workaround exists by removing the `gt-complex-x.y.jar` file from the GeoServer where `x.y` is the GeoTools version (e.g., `gt-complex-31.1.jar` if running GeoServer 2.25.1).

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could use a specially crafted file to perform actions in the security context of the current user. The file could then take actions on behalf of the logged-on user with the same permissions as the current user.\nTo exploit the vulnerability, a user must open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Word software.\nTwo possible email attack scenarios exist for this vulnerability:\n\nWith the first email attack scenario, an attacker could send a specially crafted email message to the user and wait for the user to click on the message. When the message renders via Microsoft Word in the Outlook Preview Pane, an attack could be triggered.\nWith the second scenario, an attacker could attach a specially crafted file to an email, send it to a user, and convince them to open it.\n\nIn a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability. However, an attacker would have no way to force the user to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince the user to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or other message, and then convince the user to open the specially crafted file.\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Word handles files in memory.\nFor users who view their emails in Outlook, the Preview Pane attack vector can be mitigated by disabling this feature. The following registry keys can be set to disable the Preview Pane in Outlook on Windows, either via manual editing of the registry or by modifying Group Policy.\nNote Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system.
