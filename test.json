Specifically, the vulnerability is located in the `checkProjectAccess` method within the authorization middleware, which fails to adequately verify if a user has the correct permissions to access a specific project. Instead, it only checks if the user is part of the organization owning the project, overlooking the necessary check against the `account_project` table for explicit project access rights. This flaw enables attackers to gain complete control over all resources within a project, including the ability to create, update, read, and delete any resource, compromising the privacy and security of sensitive information.","score":"9.8","source":"nvd@nist.gov","vendor":"lunary","isExploited":false,"publishedDate":"2024-06-08T20:15:52.117","lastModifiedDateFull":"2024-07-19T19:03:00.867","link":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-4146","redditScore":0},{"title":"CVE-2024-35264","description":".NET and Visual Studio Remote Code Execution Vulnerability","score":"8.1","source":"secure@microsoft.com","vendor":"microsoft","isExploited":false,"publishedDate":"2024-07-09T17:15:18.213","lastModifiedDateFull":"2024-07-19T18:59:28.370","link":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35264","redditScore":0},{"title":"CVE-2024-30105","description":".NET Core and Visual Studio Denial of Service Vulnerability","score":"7.5","source":"secure@microsoft.com","vendor":"microsoft","isExploited":false,"publishedDate":"2024-07-09T17:15:17.200","lastModifiedDateFull":"2024-07-19T18:59:11.433","link":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-30105","redditScore":0},{"title":"CVE-2024-35338","description":"Tenda i29V1.0 V1.0.0.5 was discovered to contain a hardcoded password for root.","score":"9.8","source":"nvd@nist.gov","vendor":"tendacn","isExploited":false,"publishedDate":"2024-07-16T16:15:04.933","lastModifiedDateFull":"2024-07-19T18:58:08.977","link":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35338","redditScore":0},{"title":"CVE-2024-33182","description":"Tenda AC18 V15.03.3.10_EN was discovered to contain a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability via the deviceId parameter at ip/goform/addWifiMacFilter.","score":"9.8","source":"nvd@nist.gov","vendor":"tendacn","isExploited":false,"publishedDate":"2024-07-16T16:15:04.850","lastModifiedDateFull":"2024-07-19T18:56:50.050","link":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-33182","redditScore":0},{"title":"CVE-2024-33180","description":"Tenda AC18 V15.03.3.10_EN was discovered to contain a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability via the deviceId parameter at ip/goform/saveParentControlInfo.","score":"9.8","source":"nvd@nist.gov","vendor":"tendacn","isExploited":false,"publishedDate":"2024-07-16T16:15:04.767","lastModifiedDateFull":"2024-07-19T18:56:27.127","link":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-33180","redditScore":0},{"title":"CVE-2024-4680","description":"A vulnerability in zenml-io/zenml version 0.56.3 allows attackers to reuse old session credentials or session IDs due to insufficient session expiration.

The `uv_getaddrinfo` function in `src/unix/getaddrinfo.c` (and its windows counterpart `src/win/getaddrinfo.c`), truncates hostnames to 256 characters before calling `getaddrinfo`. This behavior can be exploited to create addresses like `0x00007f000001`, which are considered valid by `getaddrinfo` and could allow an attacker to craft payloads that resolve to unintended IP addresses, bypassing developer checks. The vulnerability arises due to how the `hostname_ascii` variable (with a length of 256 bytes) is handled in `uv_getaddrinfo` and subsequently in `uv__idna_toascii`. When the hostname exceeds 256 characters, it gets truncated without a terminating null byte. As a result attackers may be able to access internal APIs or for websites (similar to MySpace) that allows users to have `username.example.com` pages. Internal services that crawl or cache these user pages can be exposed to SSRF attacks if a malicious user chooses a long vulnerable username. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.48.0. Users are advised to upgrade.
