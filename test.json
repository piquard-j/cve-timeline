It permits the visual reordering of characters via control sequences, which can be used to craft source code that renders different logic than the logical ordering of tokens ingested by compilers and interpreters. Adversaries can leverage this to encode source code for compilers accepting Unicode such that targeted vulnerabilities are introduced invisibly to human reviewers. NOTE: the Unicode Consortium offers the following alternative approach to presenting this concern. An issue is noted in the nature of international text that can affect applications that implement support for The Unicode Standard and the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm (all versions). Due to text display behavior when text includes left-to-right and right-to-left characters, the visual order of tokens may be different from their logical order. Additionally, control characters needed to fully support the requirements of bidirectional text can further obfuscate the logical order of tokens. Unless mitigated, an adversary could craft source code such that the ordering of tokens perceived by human reviewers does not match what will be processed by a compiler/interpreter/etc. The Unicode Consortium has documented this class of vulnerability in its document, Unicode Technical Report #36, Unicode Security Considerations. The Unicode Consortium also provides guidance on mitigations for this class of issues in Unicode Technical Standard #39, Unicode Security Mechanisms, and in Unicode Standard Annex #31, Unicode Identifier and Pattern Syntax. Also, the BIDI specification allows applications to tailor the implementation in ways that can mitigate misleading visual reordering in program text; see HL4 in Unicode Standard Annex #9, Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm.","lastModifiedDate":"2024-06-11","lastModifiedHour":"16:15","score":"8.3","source":"nvd@nist.gov","vendor":"unicode","isExploited":false},{"title":"CVE-2021-37253","description":"M-Files Web before 20.10.9524.1 allows a denial of service via overlapping ranges (in HTTP requests with crafted Range or Request-Range headers).

The `uv_getaddrinfo` function in `src/unix/getaddrinfo.c` (and its windows counterpart `src/win/getaddrinfo.c`), truncates hostnames to 256 characters before calling `getaddrinfo`. This behavior can be exploited to create addresses like `0x00007f000001`, which are considered valid by `getaddrinfo` and could allow an attacker to craft payloads that resolve to unintended IP addresses, bypassing developer checks. The vulnerability arises due to how the `hostname_ascii` variable (with a length of 256 bytes) is handled in `uv_getaddrinfo` and subsequently in `uv__idna_toascii`. When the hostname exceeds 256 characters, it gets truncated without a terminating null byte. As a result attackers may be able to access internal APIs or for websites (similar to MySpace) that allows users to have `username.example.com` pages. Internal services that crawl or cache these user pages can be exposed to SSRF attacks if a malicious user chooses a long vulnerable username. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.48.0.

The root cause is a potential integer overflow in `sizeof(char*) * (f->comment_list_length)` which may make `setup_malloc` allocate less memory than required. Since there is another integer overflow an attacker may overflow it too to force `setup_malloc` to return 0 and make the exploit more reliable. This issue may lead to code execution.","lastModifiedDate":"2024-06-10","lastModifiedHour":"17:16","score":"7.8","source":"nvd@nist.gov","vendor":"nothings","isExploited":false},{"title":"CVE-2023-3550","description":"Mediawiki v1.40.0 does not validate namespaces used in XML files.\n\nTherefore, if the instance administrator allows XML file uploads,\n\na remote attacker with a low-privileged user account can use this\n\nexploit to become an administrator by sending a malicious link to\n\nthe instance administrator.\n\n\n\n","lastModifiedDate":"2024-06-10","lastModifiedHour":"17:16","score":"7.3","source":"help@fluidattacks.com","vendor":"mediawiki","isExploited":false},{"title":"CVE-2023-31122","description":"Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability in mod_macro of Apache HTTP Server.This issue affects Apache HTTP Server: through 2.4.57.\n\n","lastModifiedDate":"2024-06-10","lastModifiedHour":"17:16","score":"7.5","source":"nvd@nist.gov","vendor":"apache","isExploited":false},{"title":"CVE-2023-27974","description":"Bitwarden through 2023.2.1 offers password auto-fill when the second-level domain matches, e.g., a password stored for an example.com hosting provider when customer-website.example.com is visited.
