The `uv_getaddrinfo` function in `src/unix/getaddrinfo.c` (and its windows counterpart `src/win/getaddrinfo.c`), truncates hostnames to 256 characters before calling `getaddrinfo`. This behavior can be exploited to create addresses like `0x00007f000001`, which are considered valid by `getaddrinfo` and could allow an attacker to craft payloads that resolve to unintended IP addresses, bypassing developer checks. The vulnerability arises due to how the `hostname_ascii` variable (with a length of 256 bytes) is handled in `uv_getaddrinfo` and subsequently in `uv__idna_toascii`. When the hostname exceeds 256 characters, it gets truncated without a terminating null byte. As a result attackers may be able to access internal APIs or for websites (similar to MySpace) that allows users to have `username.example.com` pages. Internal services that crawl or cache these user pages can be exposed to SSRF attacks if a malicious user chooses a long vulnerable username. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.48.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","score":"7.3","source":"nvd@nist.gov","vendor":"libuv","isExploited":false,"publishedDate":"2024-02-07T22:15:10.173","lastModifiedDateFull":"2024-07-18T01:15:13.310","link":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24806","redditScore":0},{"title":"CVE-2024-28995","description":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolarWinds Serv-U was susceptible to a directory transversal vulnerability that would allow access to read sensitive files on the host machine.    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","score":"7.5","source":"nvd@nist.gov","vendor":"solarwinds","isExploited":true,"publishedDate":"2024-06-06T09:15:14.167","lastModifiedDateFull":"2024-07-18T01:00:03.197","link":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28995","redditScore":2},{"title":"CVE-2024-34102","description":"Adobe Commerce versions 2.4.7, 2.4.6-p5, 2.4.5-p7, 2.4.4-p8 and earlier are affected by an Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference ('XXE') vulnerability that could result in arbitrary code execution.

Prior to versions 2.23.6, 2.24.4, and 2.25.2, multiple OGC request parameters allow Remote Code Execution (RCE) by unauthenticated users through specially crafted input against a default GeoServer installation due to unsafely evaluating property names as XPath expressions.\n\nThe GeoTools library API that GeoServer calls evaluates property/attribute names for feature types in a way that unsafely passes them to the commons-jxpath library which can execute arbitrary code when evaluating XPath expressions. This XPath evaluation is intended to be used only by complex feature types (i.e., Application Schema data stores) but is incorrectly being applied to simple feature types as well which makes this vulnerability apply to **ALL** GeoServer instances.
