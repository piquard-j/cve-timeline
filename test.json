The admin API port may be accessible on interfaces other than 127.0.0.1. NOTE: The vendor argue that this CVE is not a vulnerability because it has an inaccurate bug scope and patch links. “1) Inaccurate Bug Scope - The issue scope was on Kong's docker-compose template, and not Kong's docker image itself. In reality, this issue is not associated with any version of the Kong gateway. As such, the description stating ‘An issue was discovered in docker-kong (for Kong) through 2.0.3.’ is incorrect. This issue only occurs if a user decided to spin up Kong via docker-compose without following the security documentation. The docker-compose template is meant for users to quickly get started with Kong, and is meant for development purposes only. 2) Incorrect Patch Links - The CVE currently points to a documentation improvement as a “Patch” link: https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/d693827c32144943a2f45abc017c1321b33ff611.This link actually points to an improvement Kong Inc made for fool-proofing. However, instructions for how to protect the admin API were already well-documented here: https://docs.konghq.com/2.0.x/secure-admin-api/#network-layer-access-restrictions , which was first published back in 2017 (as shown in this commit: https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/e99cf875d875dd84fdb751079ac37882c9972949) Lastly, the hyperlink to https://github.com/Kong/kong (an unrelated Github Repo to this issue) on the Hyperlink list does not include any meaningful information on this topic.","score":"9.8","source":"nvd@nist.gov","vendor":"konghq","isExploited":false,"publishedDate":"2020-04-12T17:15:10.737","lastModifiedDateFull":"2024-08-04T12:15:35.077","link":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11710","redditScore":0},{"title":"CVE-2020-9384","description":"An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in the Change Password feature of Subex ROC Partner Settlement 10.5 allows remote authenticated users to achieve account takeover via manipulation of POST parameters.

It permits the visual reordering of characters via control sequences, which can be used to craft source code that renders different logic than the logical ordering of tokens ingested by compilers and interpreters. Adversaries can leverage this to encode source code for compilers accepting Unicode such that targeted vulnerabilities are introduced invisibly to human reviewers. NOTE: the Unicode Consortium offers the following alternative approach to presenting this concern. An issue is noted in the nature of international text that can affect applications that implement support for The Unicode Standard and the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm (all versions). Due to text display behavior when text includes left-to-right and right-to-left characters, the visual order of tokens may be different from their logical order. Additionally, control characters needed to fully support the requirements of bidirectional text can further obfuscate the logical order of tokens. Unless mitigated, an adversary could craft source code such that the ordering of tokens perceived by human reviewers does not match what will be processed by a compiler/interpreter/etc. The Unicode Consortium has documented this class of vulnerability in its document, Unicode Technical Report #36, Unicode Security Considerations. The Unicode Consortium also provides guidance on mitigations for this class of issues in Unicode Technical Standard #39, Unicode Security Mechanisms, and in Unicode Standard Annex #31, Unicode Identifier and Pattern Syntax. Also, the BIDI specification allows applications to tailor the implementation in ways that can mitigate misleading visual reordering in program text; see HL4 in Unicode Standard Annex #9, Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm.","score":"8.3","source":"nvd@nist.gov","vendor":"unicode","isExploited":false,"publishedDate":"2021-11-01T04:15:07.970","lastModifiedDateFull":"2024-08-04T04:16:04.400","link":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-42574","redditScore":0},{"title":"CVE-2021-41874","description":"An unauthorized access vulnerabiitly exists in all versions of Portainer, which could let a malicious user obtain sensitive information.
